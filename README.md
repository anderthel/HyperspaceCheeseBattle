# Hyperspace Cheese Battle

This project was created for an assignment at school based on the game in Rob Mile's "The Yellow Book".

This solution contains three projects:

  1 - This version is a simple implementation of initial ideas and is not a fully working game.

  2 - This version meets the requirements for the assignment but does not include any changes from the design.

  3 - This is the final version I spent the most time on. I focused on modularity and learning how to implement a multi-file structure.
